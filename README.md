# LCAP_Project
DA 301 Final Report
Deliverables Include:
Python Code that can take any future datasets, of the same format, and recreate visualizations based on new data
R code for Statistical analysis 
Tableau visualizations 
Data Analysis Reports 
Recommendations/Insights
Data Cleaning 

If the client plans on using the code they must download the coding softwares, R and Python. To use the code and complete the testing and visuals created on R and Python, the spreadsheets included in the Deliverables folder or spreadsheets they plan on inputting in the future must be downloaded as CSVs. Then, the code should be followed, and ideally copied down to the same variable names for it to run. Once the code runs there should be statistical tests available on R and visuals from Python.  There is an interactive Tableau dashboard included which provides visuals as well (https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/mikebednarekstableau/workbooks/786432?:origin=card_share_link). To create new visuals in Tableau, spreadsheets in any format have to be downloaded onto the software. Users can then enter columns in the spreadsheets into the rows and columns platforms on Tableau for visuals to appear. We have cleaned the main database sent to us by LCAP so statistical testing could be completed. Other spreadsheets will be included that were sent to us by LCAP or created on our own using Census data that were used for testing or visuals. 
The specifics of what is in included is:
The final report
R code provided statistcal tests 
Python code providing visuals
Links to Census Data that was used
A link to a Tableau workbook
Visuals in PDF from another Tableau workbook
Excel files given to us from LCAP (regarding age, race, gender, poverty, and ZIP code)
Excel spreadsheets with population per age by ZIP code, and average monthly income for each ZIP code
A CSV with latitude and longitude used to make the Python graphics
